			How to Crit by Mitch Goldstein <br>


			Discussion Questions:
			<ol>
				<li>What are some challenges you face when giving a critique? </li>
				<li>How do you handle a critique that you disagree with?</li>
				<li>Why do you think it’s important to give and receive critiques? </li>
			</ol>
		</h3>

		<ol>
			<li> <p>One challenge I face when I give a critique is that I feel like I do have not enough information on certain topics to give proper advice to the one receiving the critique. If I feel like I have enough information or knowledge, I might question my own opinions to see how they would help the creator. If the creator has a digital or technical aspect to it, I can always help with cleaning up the code or making things easier to read in coding. Sometimes I feel memorized by the project, and I cannot give advice. However, I do usually always express what I appreciate from the work and try to include an idea of how to expand that idea.  But if I just say that, I definitely face the feeling as if I did not give enough input on one's project. </p> </li>

			<li> <p>
			When I am receiving a critique, and it does not necessarily agree with my idea for the project, I will experiment with the idea and try to incorporate it into the project or work. For example, if it is adding an object or function, I will save my previous work and incorporate the critique in the creation to see if I like it. I will even take the idea and branch out from that idea to perhaps incorporate it into my work. But sometimes it does not work out. I will also try to figure out if my project is not coming across the way I wanted to, such as expressing an idea or making one feel an emotion. I might even ask the person for an example of how to incorporate it into the project, and try to see things from their perspective to understand their critique. </p> </li>

			<li><p>
			Finally, critiques are important as it expresses the thoughts of your peers and they are suggestions to improve your work, and how you can learn from your work to improve this or your next project. In Goldstein’s article, they state “You should walk away from getting a crit feeling empowered and excited to make the work better, not defeated and miserable from the experience. It is up to both the givers and the receivers of the critique to make this happen.” (Goldstein, par 6). I think it's important to state what one is feeling when observing the project, to help the creator gain a new perspective. A chance to learn something new.</p></li>

			What Screens Want by Frank Chimero
			<br>

			Discussion Questions:
			<ol>
				<li>Where do you stand with the two ideological camps: flat and skeuo? For example, do you think one is "better" than the other or do you strongly believe in one or the other.</li>
				<li>What is a zoopraxiscope and how does it relate to web and interaction design? Find another example from filmmaking or another medium that has inspired digital design.</li>
				<li>Do you agree with that screens want "flux"? Explain why you do or do not. </li>
			</ol>
		</h3>

		<ol>
			<li> <p>The ideological camps of flat and skeuo are design choices made for technologies that use a flat screen. The design of a flat is the concept of staying in the two-dimensional aspect, things that are flat should look flat. While skeuo or skeuomorphs design brings a three-dimensional space to the two-dimensional screen. I think both designs are important to use as the intentions of the creator will opt to use either for their own design. I can see both reasons to use each design, however, I do really enjoy skeuomorphs concepts. I feel as though it is the way of the future of design, and it's refreshing to see innovative ideas that create a three-dimensional screen. Recently, I made somewhat of a skeuomorph, a music synth. I made this with code on the Arduino ITO 33, and use the gyroscope to play a variety of types of music.  </p> </li>

			<li> <p>
			The Zoopraxiscope is the very first example of animation. It is a wheel with keyframes, or specific pictures that, when spun an animation is made through the motion. It is comparable to the thumb book or flipbook, in which someone draws keyframes and flips through the pages to make an animation. I think it relates to web and interaction design due to coding. When using the interactive design we have to understand how the HTML element moves in keyframes. Such as to the left, and to the right, shaking, hovering. We have to be precise in the keyframes to create a positive user experience The code we usually want to be seamless where the user just looks and does not question it. Another example would be camera motion. Where the user's perspective shifts, as if they turn their own heads to view a different direction. This is used in game design, and even animation as well. </p> </li>

			<li><p>I believe flux is the ability to be a more user-friendly or fluid motion design, it being in the physical space or digital. For the digital aspect, I think most creators want flu. Flux has the ability to add personality, uniqueness, interactiveness or qualities that are different from other websites, and that usually stick within the user’s mind. Flux in the medium level from Chimero’s article is not over the top, but simple animations or interactivity, based on the senses. I think an early example of flux is MySpace website, in which people can add their favourite music for the user to listen to when they look on their profile. It communicates a personality from the creator to the user, through the website.</p></li>

		Touring Complete User by Olia Lialina
			<br>

			Discussion Questions:
			<ol>
				<li>What do you think is Lialina's opinion of the word "user"? </li>
				<li>What is Lialina's ideal internet user? Provide some of the qualities that she outlines.</li>
				<li>From your own experiences interacting on the web—what is an example where there are "gaps that can be filled by users"? </li>
			</ol>
		</h3>

		<ol>
			<li> <p>In Lialina’s opinion, the word “user” is a “General Purpose User”, one who “…have the ability to achieve their goals regardless of the primary purpose of an application or device.” (par, 46). It is a human that uses the software or hardware but they are also perfectly capable to use other means of getting their goals, such as a paper schedule or a board game. Lialina makes an example of tweeting, but to tweet without using Twitter, such as writing in a journal or using a different website or application to tweet. They also disagree with the idea that one “ understand computers or u are the user.” (par, 70). This means that you can be a user even if you understand or don’t understand how computers work. In Lialina’s case, a user is someone that uses the computer as they want, as a tool or as a way to communicate, etc. Though they do agree with the statement “ we need to learn programming and understand our computers in order to not be programmed and ‘demand transparency of other systems’ ” but the lack of education in technology would not make this possible for all, so we must adapt. I think this is a great way to define the word “user”, as a user is someone who uses something. Someone does not need to know the in’s and out’s of a device or software to use it.   </p> </li>

			<li> <p>
			Lialina’s ideal internet user is someone that can go to other sources to use the same tool, “ “ …have the ability to achieve their goals regardless of the primary purpose of an application or device.” (par, 46). Another ideal internet user to Lialina is the “busy” type, where they don't have time to learn complex button layouts or interactions the software or hardware has. It creates the feeling of the user being a concept the creators had in mind, other than an afterthought. Finally, a last ideal internet user for Lialina is where everyone understands how a computer works, as they agree with the statement “ we need to learn programming and understand our computers in order to not be programmed and “demand transparency of other systems” ”.</p> </li>

			<li><p>In my own experiences interacting on the web, I believe there are lots of examples where there are “gaps that can be filled by the users”. One would be web interaction, in which a user is needed to complete the interaction between human and digital, such as moving the mouse to click the button or press play on a video. But it can also be more advanced, such as scrolling to play an animation and drawing to play music. Of course, someone can program it to be random input instead of user input, but the user still needs to access the website to activate the website to be “used”. Another gap that can be filled by users is web-based browser games. Without the user, the game does not exist, because there is no one to play it.</p></li>

		My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge by Laurel Schwulst
			<br>

			Discussion Questions:
			<ol>
				<li>Why does Laurel SchwulstLinks to an external site. advocate for individual websites over social media? Do you agree with her? Please explain your answer.</li>
				<li>In this article, Schwulst outlines several metaphors defining the behaviour of websites. Write a paragraph describing your own metaphor for a website. Put that text into its own simple website designed to extend that comparison. Upload it to your github server and post the link here.</li>
				
			</ol>
		</h3>

		<ol>
			<li> <p>Schwulst advocates for the individual website rather than big companies, because they think that the web is “an interconnected web of individual nodes breathing life into a vast network.”. They talk about how individuals can use the web to put it back to its original architecture, make it personal to themselves. They want artists to use websites or the internet as a way to express themselves, and not be intimidated by the process. I do agree that people should have more meaning on the internet rather than companies that thrive on their own data to make money. I think most people nowadays see the internet as a way to make money. I think social media is somewhat important to communicate with each other, however social media comes with a lot of problems as well. The individual websites can be more than a portfolio, it can be a user experience, a story it anything else. </p> </li>

			<li> <p>
			The web is like a spiral, once you enter it you have a chance of getting lost in it. The internet is forever moving, as long as humans exist, the internet will. It's like the infinite, with millions of websites to explore, accounts to see, people to meet, videos to watch, opinions to read and so on. Spirals, changing colours, different speeds.

		<h3>
		The Poetry of Tools by Mindy Seu
			<br>

			Discussion Questions:
			<ol>
				<li>In the opening paragraph of her post, Seu asks you, the reader to join her to 'defamiliarize our tools.' What do you think she means by that? And how do you think that action relates to her use of the word poetry?</li>
				<li>Seu outlines 6 categories within her taxonomy of tool poetics (Slow Growth & Slow Death, Early Works, Performing Data, Removing Function from Form, Production of Errors, & Regeneration). Choose at least one of these categories and define it in your own words. Now find a website or online interface* not mentioned in her post that you feel operates within the chosen definition. Explain why.</li>
				
			</ol>
		</h3>

		<ol>
			<li> <p>To “defamiliarize our tools.” Seu asks the reader to deconstruct the ‘normal’ use of digital interaction. They want to break the limitations of both the physical and digital sides of the daily technology we use, such as swipe, click, and print. The poetry of tools means to use technology in unconventional ways. In the examples Seu gives, each one is unique and raises questions about what is technology, its purpose, and what limitations can be broken. I think those actions relate to the word poetry, as it expresses an idea through code. While coding is not full of rhymes, alliterations, and other poetry devices, it can be used to create something poetic, in which it expresses an idea, feeling or thoughts of the artist. Technological poetry is what the user experiences, letting coding be the tool we use.  </p> </li>

			<li> <p>
			In Seu’s six categories, “Slow Growth and Slown Death”, takes the concept of something immortalized, technology and gives it a time limit or “life”. For the first example, Eduardo Kac, Genesis, combines the growth of bacteria and the interaction of web-based users. Depending on the users, they can provide light for this bacteria or reduce the amount of growth there is. I think the fact that the bacteria comes from a biblical verse, converted into a DNA strand relates to the concept of life and death. The web users when controlling the amount of light, play a part in growth and death, symbolizing the biblical God in a way. However, I don’t think the website will die, even if the bacteria is dead. Users can still control the light long after the overall function of the website is gone. The two examples bring up the question of what is life, and what is it in a digital aspect. I would define these types of media as technology afterlife. Another example that can relate to slow growth and slow death is https://www.twitch.tv/ (Links to an external site.) . I use twitch as an example because it is the growth and slow death of humans. Thinking of this site in an abstract view, users watch an entertainer grow as a person for as long as they are active on this site. When the entertainer stops being active, what happens to them? Their profile never dies, because it will always be there, years after even, a user can still experience their content.</p> </li>
