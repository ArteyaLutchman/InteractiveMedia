	<h2> Exercise 1: Self-Portrait</h2>

	<p>
		Hey everyone! 

I am Arteya Lutchman, 3rd-year Digital Futures! Planning to have a career in the gaming industry! I am from Canada but my family is from Trinidad and Tobago. I have an interest in digital technology, video game, anime, art and many other things. I create video game concepts and have knowledge of coding and 3d modelling.  The online tool I used is a machine learning manga creation made by Google experiments. Using machine learning and art to create something I really enjoy was really fun! This tool expresses my interests in coding, technology and manga. Hopefully, you can use it too. Google has a lot of experiments in different technologies that uses a variety of subjects, you may find some others you like.
