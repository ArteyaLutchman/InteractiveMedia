            At first, thinking about the interaction of dragging, I could only think about using the drag to look around on a canvas, or from the perspective of the user. I have forgotten about how seamlessly the drag element is implemented in web design. Some other interactions I found are drawing, drag to scroll, sliders, drag to rotate, move elements, and other very experimental ideas. 

At first, I wanted to mimic paper cut out on the webpage, where the user draws an image and then they are able to move the element around. But I found that to be very straightforward, and overall didnâ€™t like the idea too much. 

Another idea I have is for the user to drag around the webpage, like scrolling to find weird items to put in their inventory. There would be a different theme of items, such as internet culture photos, horror items, and cute items. 

Next would be combining sound, visuals and interactions. The user would drag the mouse around the screen, and depending on where the mouse is different visuals and sounds will play. A right click-drag would change the sound.
